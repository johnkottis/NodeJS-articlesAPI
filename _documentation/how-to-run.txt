	I am using cherome's application Advanced Rest Client	
	https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo

#7	http://localhost:3000/articles lists all articles in database (Initially should be empty) use GET to retrieve data

#8	Use POST method to insert data
		var article_headline = req.body.article_headline,
        article_fullContent = req.body.article_fullContent,
        article_channel = req.body.article_channel,
        article_status = req.body.article_status,
        article_author = req.body.article_author;

#9	Use DELETE method to delete data

#10	Use PUT method to update data
		var id = req.body.id,
        headline = req.body.article_headline,
        fullContent = req.body.article_fullContent,
        channel = req.body.article_channel,
        author = req.body.article_author,
        statuss = req.body.article_statuss;

#11 Author and status are plain string without dependencies on other tables/ collections.
	In a production enviroment these two are going to be FKs to the authors and status tables.

#12	In order to get articles from a channel request:
	http://localhost:3000/articles/channel/{channel-name}
